## Initial game planning
After deciding what my project would be, I started thinking of what technologies to use and how to get started. I was going to use HTML5, CSS, JavaScript, jquery and bootstrap for making the game board and loggics. But after I did some research I find out it will be easy for me to use canvas instead of jquery and bootstrap.
I made a rough sketch of how I want my game board to look like and what variables and function I'll need to declare.

## Putting it all together
I started the website design by laying out my HTML elements, then came the styling with CSS which took me awhile because styling is not my strongest suit. I then began planning my game loggics in Javascript. I first made prototypes of some of the functions that I needed and decleared some variables. I drew all my objects on canvas. I spent some time trying to figure out how to make my ball,paddle to move and how to apply keyboard functionality to my paddle movement, as some I got them working I moved on to working on my collision detection loggic which took pretty much most of my time. As soon as got the collision detection working I then implemented my win/lose condition, score and live tracking, and instruction which didn't take me that long. Then finally decided to add some background and sounds to the game.
